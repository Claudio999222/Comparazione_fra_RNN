# Comparison_of_RNN_Architectures

## Overview

This notebook aims to compare the performance of different recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, specifically focusing on the following types: RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Vanilla RNN. The primary objective is to analyze and contrast their capabilities in capturing sequential patterns and long-term dependencies.

## Key Objectives:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Load and preprocess the dataset suitable for a sequential data task, considering both input features and the target variable.

2. **Architecture Comparison**: Create four neural network architectures, each based on a different type of neuron (RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Vanilla). Define the structure, including input shape, layer(s), and output layer.

3. **Model Training**: Train each architecture on the prepared dataset. Monitor key training metrics such as loss and accuracy.

4. **Results Comparison**: Analyze and compare the training results of each architecture. Evaluate their performance on a test set.

## Why Compare RNN Architectures?

- **Understanding Architectural Differences**: Different types of neurons (RNN, LSTM, GRU, Vanilla RNN) have distinct architectural characteristics, affecting their ability to model sequential data.

- **Performance Considerations**: Comparing the performance metrics (loss, accuracy) helps in understanding which architecture performs better on the given task.

- **Choosing the Right Architecture**: The comparison assists in selecting the most suitable architecture for specific sequential data tasks based on empirical evidence.

This notebook provides insights into the comparative analysis of RNN architectures, aiding in the selection of the most appropriate architecture for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data.
